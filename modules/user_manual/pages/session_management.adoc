= Session Management

The personal settings page allows you to have an overview of the connected browsers and clients.

[[sessions]]
== Sessions

In the list of sessions you see which browsers and clients are connected to your account recently. You can use the trash icon to terminate any of the sessions in the list. If you want to lock out a user, you would need to change his password and then terminate his session. You can not terminate the session you are using to access the sessions page.

[[app-passwords]]
== App Passswords

At the bottom of the list you find a button to create a new device-specific password. You can choose a name to identify the token later. The generated password is used for configuring the new client. Ideally, generate individual tokens for every device you connect to your account, so you can disconnect those individually if necessary.


NOTE: You have only access to the device password when creating it, ownCloud will not save the plain password, hence itâ€™s recommended to enter the password on the new client immediately.

NOTE: If two-factor authentication is enabled for your account, device-specific passwords are the only way to configure clients. The client will deny connections of clients using your login password then.
